# Graduate-Admission-Prediction-ANN

A simple project which uses the Sequential ANN model to predict Graduate Admissions (i.e. Chance of Admit) based on the following factors :-

1. GRE Score	
2. TOEFL Score	
3. University Rating	
4. SOP	
5. LOR	
5. CGPA	
6. Research	


Stages of the project include :-

1. Cleaning the data (removing, adding, formatting colummns to match requirements)
2. Splitting the data-set into training & test set
3. Using MinMax Scaling
4. Building the ANN model
5. Training the model with 500 epochs
6. Checking r2 score for accuracy


Number of parameters for each layer are 56, 56 and 8 respectively.
r2 score stands out to be 0.8094506231092925.
